Objective of example:
=====================
Demonstrates how to:
- Create magnetic field file in text format


CoilSetup_ProtoMPEX:
=====================
This spreadsheet contains the geometrical information of the Proto-MPEX coils:
- Power supply per coil
- Coil axial location
- Coil width and heigth
- Coil radius
- Number of winding layers
- Date the configuration was made effective
- Comment on configuration

As of 2020-02-06, this spreadsheet contains up to 6 different coil arrangements dating back from 2017-06-08 to 2019-09-24
The coil arrangement changes were driven by different experimental needs
